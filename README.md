# Asteroids
Small little game I made with pygame

## Dependencies

The python file needs `pygame` to be run, the compile file needs both `pygame` and `cx_Freeze` to run.

## Freezing

The python file named `compile.py` is deditcated to freezing the game for release. It uses `cx_Freeze` to freeze the game and turn it into a standalone executable. Look in the `cx_Freeze` docs for more info.
